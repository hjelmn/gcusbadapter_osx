gcusbadapter_osx


This project builds two kernel extensions for OSX to support the WUP-028 USB
GameCube adaper. The first, gcusbadapter_raw.kext is a codeless kernel extension
that allows user-space drivers to function. This extension can be used with
the Dolphin emulator for native support. The second kernel exension,
gcusbadapter.kext exposes the WUP-028 as 4 virtual gamepads with force-feedback
support. The virual gamepads are created/destroyed as controllers are plugged in/
unplugged from the WUP-028.

A signed version of this extension is not availble at this time.
